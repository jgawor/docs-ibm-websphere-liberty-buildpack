To deploy applications using the IBM WebSphere Liberty for PCF buildpack, you are required to accept the IBM Liberty license and IBM JRE license by following the instructions below:

1. Read the current IBM [Liberty-License][] and the current IBM [JVM-License][].
2. Extract the `D/N: <License code>` from the Liberty-License and JVM-License.
3. Add the following environment variables and extracted license codes to the `manifest.yml` file in the directory from which you push your application. For further information on the format of
the `manifest.yml` file refer to the [manifest documentation][].

    <pre>

      ...
      env:
        IBM_JVM_LICENSE: &lt;JVM license code&gt;
        IBM_LIBERTY_LICENSE:  &lt;Liberty license code&gt;
    </pre>

After you have set the license acceptance environment variables, use the following command to deploy the application with the IBM WebSphere Liberty for PCF buildpack:
